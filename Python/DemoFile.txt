Public speaking becomes easier when you prepare well and stay confident. Start by understanding your topic clearly so you know what you want to say. Practice your speech a few times to reduce nervousness, but avoid memorizing it word by word. Speak slowly and clearly, and pause when needed to let your points sink in. Maintain eye contact with the audience to build connection and confidence. Use simple words and examples so everyone can understand you easily. Keep your posture straight, use natural hand gestures, and smile to appear calm and friendly. Most importantly, believe in yourself and remember that the audience wants to listen to you, not judge you.Now the file has more content!
